# WESTERN PEPSI PINBALL
 
This is a remake of the already existing pinball game by pepsi for academic purposes only, our main goal was to get an accurate version of the original game. 
However, there are some differences, in the original game whenever you take down all cowboys, a minigame opens when you enter the saloon, we weren't able to replicate that
